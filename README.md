## Architecture

In order to organize the code of an AutoIT application with a graphical interface, we propose to use the following model.

```
project root folder
|
|   myApplication.au3          # Main entry program
|   myApplication_GLOBAL.au3   # All global variables declaration
|   myApplication_GUI.au3      # Main program to handle GUI
|   myApplication_LOGIC.au3    # Business code only
|   README.md                  # Cause We always need it
|  
+---assets                     # All applications assets (images, files...)
|   +---css
|   +---html
|   +---images
|   \---javascript
|
+---deployment                
|   \---releases               # Contains releases setup (zip and Windows setup files)
|   deployment.bat             # Windows batch bandmaster to pilot the creation of the Windows setup
|   deploymeny.iss             # ISS to generate Windows setup
|
+---vendor                     # All third-party code use in this project
|   \--- FolderVendor
|              
\---views                      # Views declaration
    View_About.au3
    View_Footer.au3
    View_Welcome.au3
```


### Directory `assets`

This directory contains the elements used in the application like images, text files, pdf, html, css, javascript. Indeed, note that it is possible to integrate in a AutoIt application, a static html file, into a web browser embedded in the HMI with the `_IECreateEmbedded ()` method provided by the `IE.au3` library.


### Directory `deployment`

This directory contains a Windows batch that controls the creation of a Windows installer with the [InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) solution. To run the batch, it is necessary that the InnoSetup compiler and 7zip be installed on the pc. If this is not the case, I advise you to use the Windows package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install them simply:

```
C: \> choco install 7zip
C: \> choco install innosetup
```


### Directory `vendor`

This directory is the place where to conventionally store the code developed by third parties in a project. In this project (https://github.com/v20100v/autoit-gui-skeleton), we have for example put the GUICtrlOnHover v2.0 library created by G.Sandler a.k.a MrCreatoR in this directory.


### Directory `views`

This directory contains view managers. All the code of all the views are defined each time in a specific file and stored in that directory.


### AGS overview

![](docsOld3/assets/images/autoit-gui-skeleton_overview.png)


<br/>

## Code Organization

> Explain the organization of the code of a project respecting the AGS conventions. We describe below its main elements.

### Main entry program

The `myApplication.au3` program serves as a single point of entry for our application. This is where the application starts. In the latter we start by including all the other dependencies that it needs: libraries of AutoIt, third-party libraries, the declaration of global variables, the code of the application GUI and business. It calls a single method: `_main_GUI ()`. It is the main GUI manager that is used to build the interface and manage user interactions.

```AutoIt
;; myApplication.au3 ;;

Opt('MustDeclareVars', 1)

; Include all built-in AutoIt library requires
#include <IE.au3>
#include <GUIConstantsEx.au3>
#include <WinAPIDlg.au3>

; Include all third-party code in a project store in vendor directory
#include 'vendor/GUICtrlOnHover/GUICtrlOnHover.au3'

; Include myApplication scripts
#include 'myApplication_GLOBAL.au3'
#include 'myApplication_GUI.au3'
#include 'myApplication_LOGIC.au3'

; Start main graphic user interface defined in myApplication_GUI.au3
_main_GUI()
```


### Centralize the declaration of global variables

This script is used to define all the constants and variables of the application in the overall scope of the program, with the exception of graphic elements, which are defined in a specific view file. Moreover by convention, all the variables declared in `myApplication_GLOBALS.au3` must be written in capital letters and separated by underscores.

The `Global` statement is used to explicitly indicate which access to the scope is desired for a variable. If you declare a variable with the same name as a parameter, using Local in a user function, an error will occur. Global can be used to assign global variables within a function, but if a local variable (or parameter) has the same name as a global variable, the local variable will be the only one used. It is recommended that local and global variables have distinct names.

The statement `Global Const` is used to declare a constant. Once created a global constant, you can not change the value of a constant. In addition, you can not replace an existing variable with a constant.

```AutoIt
;; myApplication_GLOBAL.au3 ;;

; Application main constants
Global Const $APP_NAME = "myApplication"
Global Const $APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"
Global Const $APP_WEBSITE = "https://myApplication-website.org"
Global Const $APP_EMAIL_CONTACT = "myApplication@website.org"
Global Const $APP_ID = "acme.myApplication"
Global Const $APP_LIFE_PERIOD = "2016-"&@YEAR
Global Const $APP_COPYRIGHT = "Â© "&$APP_LIFE_PERIOD&", A.C.M.E."

; Application GUI constants
Global Const $APP_WIDTH = 800
Global Const $APP_HEIGHT = 600
Global Const $APP_GUI_TITLE_COLOR = 0x85C4ED
Global Const $APP_GUI_LINK_COLOR = 0x5487FB

; Application global variable
; Example in order to persist an opened file on action "File > Open"
Global $OPEN_FILE = False
Global $OPEN_FILE_PATH = -1
Global $OPEN_FILE_NAME = -1
```


### Write the business/logic code in dedicated files

In this model, we add a `myApplication_LOGIC.au3` file that contains all the methods of the business code. These logical methods are then called by others usually triggered by user interactions, whose links are defined in the GUI. Simple principle of separation between logic and view.

For example, we manage a dialog box as follows:

```AutoIt
;; myApplication_LOGIC.au3 ;;

;===========================================================================================================
; Show a dialog box to user, in order that he chooses a file in the Windows Explorer
;
; @params : void
; @return : $array_result[0] = file path
;           $array_result[1] = file name
;===========================================================================================================
Func _dialogbox_open()
   Local $info_fichier = _WinAPI_GetOpenFileName("Open file", "*.*", @WorkingDir, "", _
                          "", 2, BitOR($OFN_ALLOWMULTISELECT, $OFN_EXPLORER), _
              $OFN_EX_NOPLACESBAR)
   Local $array_result[2]

   If @error Then
      $array_result[0] = -1
      $array_result[1] = -1
   Else
      ; Chemin relatif du nouveau fichier
      $array_result[0] = $info_fichier[1]&"\"&$info_fichier[2] ; $PATHFILE_OF_OPEN_FILE_IN_APP
      $array_result[1] = $info_fichier[2] ; $NAME_OF_OPEN_FILE_IN_APP
   EndIf

   Return $array_result
EndFunc
```


### Main program to manage the GUI

The `myApplication_GUI.au3` file contains the` _main_GUI () `method which is called by the main input program. This method is designed to create the graphical user interface (GUI) and manage all user interactions and events. So it calls all the other methods that initialize the elements of the GUI.

```AutoIt
;; myApplication_GUI.au3 ;;

#include-once

; Includes all views definition
#include './views/View_Footer.au3'
#include './views/View_Welcome.au3'
#include './views/View_About.au3'

;==============================================================================================================
; Main graphic user interface
;
; @param void
; @return void
;==============================================================================================================
Func _main_GUI()
   Global $main_GUI = GUICreate($APP_NAME, $APP_WIDTH, $APP_HEIGHT, -1, -1)

   _GUI_Init_Menu()

   _GUI_Init_Footer()       ; By default all elements of this view are visible
   _GUI_Init_View_Welcome() ; By default all elements of this view are hidden
   _GUI_Init_View_About()   ; By default all elements of this view are hidden

   ; Set configuration application : icon, background color
   _GUI_Configuration()

   ; Show Welcome view on startup
   _GUI_ShowHide_View_Welcome($GUI_SHOW)
   GUISetState(@SW_SHOW)

   ; Handle all user interactions and events
   _GUI_HandleEvents()

   GUIDelete()
   Exit
EndFunc

(...)
```


Some comments:

- All uppercase variables (`$ APP_NAME`,` $ APP_WIDTH`, `$ APP_HEIGHT`) are declared in the global scope of the application. Their definition is done in the file `myApplication_GLOBAL.au3`;
- `_GUI_Init_Menu ()` is used to create a menu control in the main GUI;
- `_GUI_Init_Footer ()` is used to create footer elements in the main GUI. Its definition is made in a separate special file. All footer elements are visible in all views by default, so we do not need to manage its visibility.
- `_GUI_Init_View_Welcome ()` is used to create GUI elements for a "Welcome" view name. All items declared in this method are hidden by default. To display the "Welcome" view, that is, to make it visible, simply call the method with this parameter `_GUI_ShowHide_View_Welcome ($ GUI_SHOW)`. And to hide them, just call `_GUI_ShowHide_View_Welcome ($ GUI_HIDE)`;
- `_GUI_HandleEvents ()` handles all user interactions and events by parsing the return message with the `GUIGetMsg ()` method. The event return with the GUIGetMsg method is the control ID of the control that sends the message. This method calls another specific handler event per view, for example `_GUI_HandleEvents_View_Welcome ($ msg)`;


### Declare code for all views in dedicated files

For example, for managing the creation of the graphic elements of the "Welcome" view, we use the `_GUI_Init_View_Welcome ()` method.

```AutoIt
;; ./view/View_Welcome.au3 ;;

Func _GUI_Init_View_Welcome()
   ; Create GUI elements here for "Welcome view" in global scope
   Global $label_title_View_Welcome = GUICtrlCreateLabel("Welcome", 20, 30, 400)
EndFunc
```

For the management of the display of the elements of the "Welcome" view, we use the `_GUI_ShowHide_View_Welcome ($ action)` method

```AutoIt
;; ./view/View_Welcome.au3 ;;

Func _GUI_ShowHide_View_Welcome($action)
   Switch $action
      Case $GUI_SHOW
         ; Define here all elements to show when user come into this view
         _GUI_Hide_all_view() ; Hide all elements defined in all method _GUI_ShowHide_View_xxx
         GUICtrlSetState($label_title_View_Welcome, $GUI_SHOW)
         GUICtrlSetState($label_welcome, $GUI_SHOW)

      Case $GUI_HIDE
         ; Define here all elements to hide when user leave this view
         GUICtrlSetState($label_title_View_Welcome, $GUI_HIDE)
         GUICtrlSetState($label_welcome, $GUI_HIDE)
    EndSwitch
EndFunc
```

For event handling in the "Welcome" view, use the `_GUI_HandleEvents_View_Welcome ($ msg)` method. This method is called in the `_GUI_HandleEvents ()` main handler method.

```AutoIt
;; ./view/View_Welcome.au3 ;;

Func _GUI_HandleEvents_View_Welcome($msg)
   Switch $msg

      ; Trigger for click on $image_banner
      Case $label_welcome
         ConsoleWrite('Click on "$label_welcome"' & @CRLF)

      ; Add another trigger in view 'Welcome' here
   EndSwitch
EndFunc
```


### Main events manager

The main user and application event handler is named `_GUI_HandleEvents()`. It is the latter who will call all the other event managers specific to each view. They are named by convention `_GUI_HandleEvents_View_Xxx($msg)`.

```AutoIt
;; myApplication_GUI.au3 ;;

Func _GUI_HandleEvents()
   Local $msg
   While 1
    ; event return with GUIGetMsg method, i.e. the control ID of the control sending the message
    $msg = GUIGetMsg()
      Switch $msg
         ; Trigger on close dialog box
         Case $GUI_EVENT_CLOSE
            ExitLoop

         ; Trigger on click on item menu 'File > Exit'
         Case $menuitem_Exit
            ExitLoop
      EndSwitch

      _GUI_HandleEvents_View_Welcome($msg)
      _GUI_HandleEvents_View_About($msg)
      _GUI_HandleEvents_Menu_File($msg)
      _GUI_HandleEvents_Menu_About($msg)
   WEnd
EndFunc
```


### Switch view

To switch from a start view to another arrival view, you first have to hide all the graphic elements, then in a second time to display only those of the arrival view. So, how to hide all the graphic elements? Just with a `_GUI_Hide_all_view()` method that will call the view manager of each view. These are conventionally named `_GUI_ShowHide_View_Xxx`.

```AutoIt
;; myApplication_GUI.au3 ;;

Func _GUI_Hide_all_view()
   _GUI_ShowHide_View_Welcome($GUI_HIDE)
   _GUI_ShowHide_View_About($GUI_HIDE)
EndFunc
```

## Package & setup deployment

### Goals

In order to facilitate the deployment of a Windows desktop application, it is proposed to build a Windows installer with the solution [InnoSetup] (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

To prepare a package and generate an installer, the main steps are:

- Assign a version number to the application;
- Compile the application via the main entry point `myApplication.au3` with the` aut2exe` compiler;
- Copy the assets (images, files ...) necessary for the proper functioning of the application in the output directory;
- Create a zip archive to recover the application;
- And finally build the installer by compiling the associated InnoSetup script.

All steps, to package the application and generate the installer, can be driven from a Windows batch, for obvious reasons of replayability and ease.


### Windows batch, the bandmaster

This is the Windows batch file `.\Deployment\deployment_autoit_application.bat` which plays the role of orquestrian leader. In the `\Deployment` directory, it will create the `\releases\vx.y.z\` directories where the application zip archive and the Windows installer will be built.

![AGS-package-and-deployment](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/AGS-package-and-deployment.gif)

To do this, he will follow the following 7 steps:


<br/>

#### Step 1/7: create the output directory

Before the batch execution, it is necessary to inform different variables:

Variable | Description
-------- | -----------------
`%VERSION%` | Version assigned to the application.
`%NAME_PROJECT%` | Used to name the executable of the application. Note that the version number also appears in the executable name.
`%AUT2EXE_AU3%` | The name of the main AutoIt file (`myApplication.au3`)
`%AUT2EXE_ICON%` | The application icon (`%FOLDER_SRC%\assets\images\myApplication.ico`)
`%ZIP_CLI%` | Path of the 7zip binary to create an archive (`"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe"`). I advise you to install it via the manager Chocolatey.
`%ISCC_CLI%` | InnoSetup compiler binary path (`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5\ISCC.exe "`). I advise you to install it via the manager Chocolatey.

From these variables, it will build the output directory, in which the main AutoIt file will compile: `.\Releases\v1.0.0\myApplication_v1.0.0 \`.


<br/>

#### Step 2/7: AutoIt compilation of the main program

The main AutoIt program is compiled from the command line with the `aut2exe` binary. Attention, it is necessary that this last one is to inform in the variable of environment PATH of the operating system.

```Batch
:: deployment_autoit_application.bat ::

(...)

set AUT2EXE_ARGS=/in "%FOLDER_SRC%\%AUT2EXE_AU3%" /out "%FOLDER_OUT%\%NAME_EXE%" /icon
aut2exe %AUT2EXE_ARGS%
echo Compilation AutoIt is finished.
```


<br/>

#### Step 3/7: Copy Assets

We copy in the output directory, all assets (images, files ...) necessary for the proper functioning of the application and the generation of the installer.


<br/>

#### Step 4/7: Generation Date

To plot the build date, we create a file named `".v%VERSION%"` in the output directory.


<br/>

#### Step 5/7: Creating the zip archive

Creating the zip archive requires that 7zip is installed on the computer and that the `%ZIP_CLI%` variable is correctly filled in to the binary path. The command that generates the archive is as follows:

```Batch
set ZIP_CLI="C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe"

%ZIP_CLI% a -tzip %NAME_PROJECT%_v%VERSION%.zip "%NAME_PROJECT%_v%VERSION%
echo * The zip has been created.
```


<br/>

#### Step 6/7: Creating the Windows Installer via InnoSetup

This is the InnoSetup file `.\Deployment\deployment_autoit_application.iss` which contains all the instructions for generating the associated Windows installer.

We pass the arguments defined in the Windows batch to the ISS script via the `/dNameVariable=ValueVariable` set on the command line. Thus it is sufficient to configure only once the project variables (name, version ...) in the Windows batch file.

> ** !!! Warning !!!**
>
> In the ISS script file, there are other variables to configure: `ApplicationPublisher`,` ApplicationURL`, `ApplicationGUID`, ...

```Batch
set ISCC_CLI="C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5\ISCC.exe"
set ISCC_SCRIPT=deployment_autoit_application.iss

echo * Launch compilation with iscc
%ISCC_CLI% %ISCC_SCRIPT% /dApplicationVersion=%VERSION% /dApplicationName=%NAME_PROJECT%
echo * Compilation has been finished.
```


<br/>

#### Step 7/7: Deleting the temporary exit directory

It is sufficient to keep only the Zip archive and the Windows installer at the end of the process.

<br/>

### Features of windows setup


#### 1 - Handler i18n

In order to add a new language, just add in the section `[languages]` the language provided in the compiler. This will translate all native messages to InnoSetup. Watch out for the `YES/NO` buttons in MsgBox. It is last serves forcing in the language of the operating Windows system.

```
[Languages]
Name: "en"; MessagesFile: compiler:Default.isl;
Name: "french"; MessagesFile: "compiler:Languages\French.isl"
```

In order to translate the other messages, just declare them in the section `[CustomMessages]`, prefixing the variables with the language (`en`,` french`, `nl`, ...). More information: http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=languagessection

```
[CustomMessages]
french.CheckInstall=est dÃ©jÃ  installÃ© sur ce PC.
french.CheckInstallAction=Souhaitez-vous dÃ©sinstaller cette version existante avant de poursuivre?
en.CheckInstall=is already install on this PC.
en.CheckInstallAction=Do you want to uninstall this existing version before continuing?
```

So when starting the setup, it asks the user to choose the language he should use.

![innosetup_choose_language](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/innosetup_choose_language.png)


<br/>

#### 2 - Already install ?

In order to avoid installing the application on the client computer several times, the installer checks beforehand that it is not already present.

![](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/innosetup_check_already_install.png)

To do this, it is based on the GUID (*global unique identifier*) defined in the InnoSetup script. It is important not to change the code between different application versions and that it is unique. The IDE provided by InnoSetup provides a tool to generate a new one accessible via the menu: *Tools> Generate GUID inside the IDE*.

```
; NOTE: The value of AppId uniquely identifies this application.
; Do not use the same AppId value in installers for other applications.
; (To generate a new GUID, click Tools | Generate GUID inside the IDE.)
#define ApplicationGUID "6886E28B-AAB5-4866-BCD5-E1B4C171A87A"
#define ApplicationID ApplicationName + "_" + ApplicationGUID
```

In addition, the installer adds the `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{#ApplicationID}_is1` key into the Windows registry. When the application is uninstalled, this key is removed. So we just have to check the presence of this key in the registry to know if the application has already been installed.

![](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/innosetup_check_already_install2.png)


<br/>

#### 3 - Additional messages in the setup : license agreement, prerequisites & project history

To configure the different messages to be displayed in the installer, including the license agreements, just fill in the text files in the `./assets/` directory.

- AFTER_INSTALL.txt: usually to display the roadmap and project history;
- BEFORE_INSTALL.txt: usually to display the prerequisites of the application;
- LICENSE.txt: the license of use.

![](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/innosetup_choose_license_agreement.png)


<br/>

#### 4 - Add to Windows start menu

To add items to the Windows start menu, enter the `[Icons]` section in the InnoSetup script as follows:

```Pascal
[Icons]
Name: "{group}\{#ApplicationName}"; Filename: "{app}\{#ApplicationExeName}"; IconFilename: {app}\assets\images\myApplication.ico;
Name: "{group}\{cm:ProgramOnTheWeb,{#ApplicationName}}"; Filename: "{#ApplicationURL}";
Name: "{group}\{cm:UninstallProgram,{#ApplicationName}}"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"; IconFilename: {app}\assets\images\setup.ico;
Name: "{commondesktop}\{#ApplicationName}"; Filename: "{app}\{#ApplicationExeName}"; IconFilename: {app}\assets\images\myApplication.ico; IconIndex: 0
```

Et on obtient :

![](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/innosetup_finish2.png)


<br/>

#### 5 - Launch the application at the end of the installation

![](docsOld3/assets/images/AGS-package-deployment/innosetup_finish.png)


<br/>

### Change the graphic elements of the installer

There are 2 images and 2 icons used in the installer. They are stored in the `. \ Assets \ images` directory. The images are necessarily in the format bmp and must respect standard sizes.

Images use in setup       | File  | Comments
--------------------------|-------|---------
UninstallDisplayIcon      | .\assets\images\myApplication.ico | Must be an ico
SetupIconFile             | .\assets\images\setup.ico  | Must be an ico
WizardImageFile           | .\assets\images\innosetup_background.bmp  |  Must be a 500x313 bmp image
WizardSmallImageFile      | .\assets\images\innosetup_image.bmp  | Must be a 50x50 bmp image

Into the InnoSetup script, they are used as follows:

```Pascal
UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\assets\images\myApplication.ico
WizardImageFile={#PathAssets}\images\innosetup_background.bmp
WizardSmallImageFile={#PathAssets}\images\innosetup_image.bmp
SetupIconFile={#PathAssets}\images\setup.ico
```
